# travel-hub
    I have made a travel agency website through PHP and MySQL.
    
1. On the homepage the first thing is a big carousel of 3 images.Below which there is some text about the website and a link to about page.

2. Below the About section a carousel of 5 pages with some text about the packages.

3. On scrolling down there are 3 recent blogs by the admin are displayed and a button which takes to the blogs page.

4. Below that is the footer with a button to contact form.

---------------------Admin section -----------------------------------

5. There is a side bar on the homeapge which takes to the login form if the admin is not logged in or directly to the admin panel.

6. In the admin panel there two main sections blogs section which is currently displayed and a contacts section.In the blog section there is a add blog button and all the blogs and in the contacts section there is all the contacts who messaged.

7. On clicking on the button next to each row, you are taken to a message page where you can message the typing the subject ,content etc details in the form and this information will automatically be MAILED to the person in PDF FORMAT.

8. In the blogs section you can click on any blog and see the full block in new page and you can also add a new blog and that will also be added to the website's blog section.
